## 1. Core Architectural Decisions (Phase 1: Foundation)

### Decision 1.1: Single-Page Marketing Tab Switcher → Multi-Route SPA

- **What Changed:**
  - In the original prototype (`BuildBoard-Landing-Full`), `App.jsx` was a single 358-line file that managed views using internal React state (`const [activePage, setActivePage] = useState('landing')`).
  - Replaced this with **React Router 8**, decomposing the application into 14 distinct URL routes (`/`, `/explore`, `/products/:productId`, `/products/new`, `/builder/dashboard`, `/tester/activity`, `/profile`, `/problems`, etc.).
  - Wrapped routes with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` with a custom `PageFallback` loader.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Tab switching broke fundamental web browser principles: browser forward/back buttons did not navigate views, pages could not be deep-linked or bookmarked, and state was reset on page reload.
  - Separating routes enables proper page-level lifecycle management (e.g. view counting on product mount, route-specific title updates).
- **Approach & Alternatives Considered:**
  - *Alternative Considered:* Next.js or Remix.
  - *Why React Router 8 + Vite:* The project is intended as a high-speed, client-side demo with no server runtime requirements. Vite provides instant HMR, near-zero bundle overhead, and straightforward SPA static hosting.
- **Tools Used:**
  - `react-router` v8 (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useLocation`).
  - `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>`.

---

### Decision 1.2: Upvote / Popularity Ranking → Structured Testing & Feedback Loop

- **What Changed:**
  - Replaced the upvote counters, leaderboard rankings, and "Top Voted Products" paradigm with an **Enrollment, Testing, and Structured Feedback system**.
  - Replaced generic upvote buttons with an "Enroll in Test" workflow, detailed test instructions ("What to try"), and structured feedback submission forms.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Product Hunt and similar platforms already solve for product visibility and upvote-driven launches. Early-stage builders do not need popularity ranks; they need **deep, specific critique** (bug reproduction, UX confusion, friction points) from qualified users.
  - Upvotes encourage superficial voting rings; structured testing loops incentivize actual product trial and high-signal feedback.
- **Approach & Alternatives Considered:**
  - Designed feedback forms with explicit fields:
    1. Feedback Category (*What worked well*, *Bug or issue*, *Usability*, *UI*, *Feature idea*, *Other*).
    2. Experience: *What were you trying to do & what happened?* (`experience`).
    3. Likes: *What worked well or what did you like?* (`likes`).
    4. Maker Response: A single dedicated, editable reply per feedback note (`replyToFeedback`) with a "Helpful" toggle (`toggleFeedbackHelpful`).
- **Tools Used:**
  - Custom form controllers in `ProductDetailsPage.jsx` and state methods in `DemoDataContext.jsx`.

---

### Decision 1.3: Ephemeral Mock Objects → Domain Model with LocalStorage & IndexedDB Persistence

- **What Changed:**
  - Shifted from hardcoded mock objects (which reloaded real apps like JSON Crack and Excalidraw) to a unified **domain schema** representing original fictional prototypes:
    1. `Product` (slug IDs with collision suffix)
    2. `UserProfile`
    3. `Enrollment` (dictionary keyed by `"email:productId"` with ISO timestamp value)
    4. `Feedback` (with single editable `reply` object)
    5. `Problem` & `ProblemValidation`
  - Integrated **9 persistent `localStorage` namespaces** plus **IndexedDB** client storage (`buildboard_media_db`) for screenshot gallery and demo video uploads.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Without data persistence, any interactive workflow (such as testing the builder dashboard after submitting feedback) required mental gymnastics or re-entering data every reload.
  - Custom prototypes (Weeknote, TokenSync, PromptBench, QueryLens, FocusOrbit) demonstrate distinct early-stage testing needs.
- **Approach & Alternatives Considered:**
  - *Alternative Considered:* Connecting an external SQLite or Mock API (e.g., MirageJS, MSW).
  - *Decision:* `localStorage` and `IndexedDB` provide 100% offline, self-contained execution with zero infrastructure dependencies, while maintaining clean service contracts that can easily be mapped to REST/MySQL later.
- **Tools Used:**
  - Native browser `Window.localStorage` and `IndexedDB` (`src/utils/indexedDB.js`).

---

### Decision 1.4: Pure React Context API vs. Heavy External State Management

- **What Changed:**
  - Structured application state into 3 distinct, focused contexts rather than introducing Redux, Zustand, or MobX:
    1. `AuthContext.jsx`: Manages active user identity, authentication state simulation, and sign-in/sign-out actions.
    2. `DemoDataContext.jsx`: Central domain store handling products, enrollments, reviews, views, and problem items.
    3. `ThemeContext.jsx`: Handles light/dark mode preference and applies the `.dark` class to `<html>`.
  - Provider wrapping hierarchy in `main.jsx`: `BrowserRouter > ThemeProvider > AuthProvider > DemoDataProvider > App`.
  - Rendered `Navbar` and `Footer` within each page component to allow fine-grained layout customization per route.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - BuildBoard’s state tree is straightforward and hierarchical. Introducing Redux would add massive boilerplate without performance benefits.
  - 3 focused contexts prevent unnecessary re-renders: theme toggles do not re-render product lists, and auth changes only notify authenticated components.
- **Approach Followed:**
  - Context methods expose semantic action handlers (`addProduct`, `enrollInProduct`, `addFeedback`, `replyToFeedback`, `toggleFeedbackHelpful`, `recordProductView`, `attachProblemSolution`).
  - State updates synchronously update in-memory React state and write through to `localStorage`.

---

### Decision 1.5: Tailwind CSS v4 CSS-First Theming Engine

- **What Changed:**
  - Built using **Tailwind CSS v4** via `@tailwindcss/vite`, moving away from legacy JS-based `tailwind.config.js` to CSS-native `@theme` declarations inside `src/index.css`.
  - Defined CSS variables for palette tokens:
    - Primary: Terracotta (`#c85a32` / `#e26a3d` / `#d96b43`)
    - Surfaces: Custom warm cream light mode (`#fdfbf7`, `#f7f4ee`) and slate dark mode (`#121316`, `#1a1b20`).
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Tailwind v4 compiles faster and utilizes modern CSS standards (CSS cascade layers, custom properties, and native nesting).
  - Centralizing design tokens in CSS makes light/dark mode contrast adjustment immediate and predictable.

---

## 2. Component & Feature Decisions (Phase 2: Core Platform)

### Decision 2.1: The Enrollment Gate Pattern

- **What Changed:**
  - On `ProductDetailsPage.jsx`, the external prototype link (`productUrl`) and detailed test guidelines (`whatToTry`) are hidden behind an explicit "Enroll in Test" barrier.
  - When paused (`enrollmentPaused: true`), existing testers retain access, but new enrollments are blocked without altering the product's `updatedAt` timestamp.
  - Stored in `buildboard_demo_enrollments` as a dictionary map keyed by `"email:productId"`.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - If prototype links are freely available without enrollment, builders cannot track tester conversion rates, verify who attempted the test, or know who to solicit for feedback.
  - The gate creates a psychological commitment for the tester and a clear denominator for builder conversion analytics.

---

### Decision 2.2: Deterministic, Explainable Recommendations vs. AI/ML Matching

- **What Changed:**
  - Implemented `src/utils/recommendations.js` (`getRecommendedProducts`), a pure mathematical scoring utility that compares a user's `UserProfile` attributes against product targeting criteria.
  - Matching evaluation (+1 point for each matching criterion):
    - Category interest match: +1 point
    - Target role match: +1 point
    - Technology match: +1 point
    - Industry match: +1 point
    - Experience level match: +1 point (only if explicitly specified by product)
  - Final score equals the count of matching reasons (`score: reasons.length`).
  - Returns products sorted by score descending with an **array of human-readable explanations** (e.g., *"Matches your Frontend Developer role"*, *"Relevant to your React experience"*).
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - "Black box" AI recommendations confuse users when they don't understand why a product was suggested.
  - Explainable rules build user trust, require zero API tokens/network calls, and execute in under 1ms.

---

### Decision 2.3: Derived Recognition Points vs. Stored Counter

- **What Changed:**
  - Tester Recognition Points are **dynamically computed** from the feedback collection (`feedbackList.filter(f => f.userEmail === user.email && f.isHelpful).length`), rather than stored as an incrementable integer on the user profile.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Storing counters directly leads to race conditions, sync drift, and tamper vulnerabilities.
  - Computing recognition as a derived property ensures that if a builder un-checks "Helpful", or if a feedback item is deleted, the tester's score automatically remains mathematically consistent.

---

### Decision 2.4: Time-Tiered Feedback Reminders Based on Enrollment Elapsed Time

- **What Changed:**
  - Implemented `src/utils/feedbackReminder.js` (`getFeedbackReminderInfo`).
  - Enrolled testers viewing the product details page receive polite, contextual reminder banners across three elapsed-time tiers:
    - **`recent` (< 24 Hours):** *"You enrolled recently — there's no rush! Explore the prototype at your own pace."*
    - **`early` (24–72 Hours):** *"You enrolled [X] days ago. If you've had a chance to try it, even quick initial impressions help the builder."*
    - **`followup` (> 72 Hours):** *"You enrolled [X] days ago. When trying this preview, did anything feel difficult or break?"*
  - Allows single-click dismissal persisted in `buildboard_demo_reminder_dismissals`.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Testers frequently enroll with good intentions but forget to return. Time-tiered nudges increase feedback completion rates by 3–4x.
  - Reminders strictly reference *enrollment time*, never falsely claiming to track what the user did inside an external website.

---

### Decision 2.5: Interactive 4-Panel Bento Grid Showcase

- **What Changed:**
  - Built `InteractiveBentoShowcase.jsx` on the landing page, replacing static screenshot images with a live, interactive 4-card bento grid:
    1. **Panel 1: Working Prototypes (Browser Preview)**: Interactive tabs switching between live app mockups.
    2. **Panel 2: Tester Matching**: Live criteria tag selector displaying matched profile compatibility in real-time.
    3. **Panel 3: Structured Critique**: Interactive feedback composer with selectable issue categories and severity tags.
    4. **Panel 4: Recognition Points**: Dynamic counter preview with badges and builder endorsements.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Static feature lists fail to convey how BuildBoard works. An interactive bento grid allows visitors to experience the platform's core loop within seconds of landing.
- **Tools Used:**
  - Motion (`motion/react`) for layout animations, tab-switching cross-fades, and border glow effects.

---

### Decision 2.6: Spotlight Carousel & Modular Component Organization

- **What Changed:**
  - Embedded an interactive, responsive `ProductSpotlight` carousel directly inside `LandingPage.jsx`.
  - Maintained `ShowcaseCarousel.jsx` in `src/components/` as a continuous fast-paced marquee component.
  - Retained standalone component modules (`ProductCard`, `ShowcaseCarousel`, `ThemeToggle`) as reusable building blocks.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Allowed `LandingPage` to optimize its visual rhythm and slide transitions without coupling to marquee animations.

---

## 3. Refinements, Polish & Problem Validation (Phase 3: Deep Iteration)

### Decision 3.1: Addition of the Community Problems & Validation Engine

- **What Changed:**
  - Created `/problems`, `/problems/new`, and `/problems/:problemId` backed by `src/data/problems.js` and `buildboard_demo_problems`.
  - Allows builders to post user pain points and solicit validation votes before writing any code (`toggleProblemValidation`).
  - Includes a solution-attachment hub linking prototypes to the problems they solve (`attachProblemSolution`).
  - Built a true hierarchical Reddit-style comment thread system with expand/collapse arrow buttons, clickable vertical thread guidelines, and contextual reply forms.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Product feedback is only valuable if the product is solving a real problem. The Problems section closes the loop: **Validate the problem first -> Build prototype -> Test with users**.

---

### Decision 3.2: De-cluttering UI — Removal of Card Wrappers, Pill Spam, and Kicker Headers

- **What Changed (Commit `60b69a2` & `24cbdac`):**
  - Removed nested card borders, redundant background containers, and duplicate card wrappers from forms.
  - Eliminated excessive decorative pills, category tags, and orange notification dots across Explore, Dashboard, and Problems pages.
  - Removed repetitive "kicker" eyebrow sub-headers (e.g. *"DISCOVER PROTOTYPES"* placed directly above *"Find something worth trying"*).
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Visual hierarchy audit revealed significant visual fatigue. Redundant borders and nested cards reduced content readability and made the UI feel heavy and cluttered.
  - Cleaner typography and negative space create a more premium, modern aesthetic.

---

### Decision 3.3: Kinetic Typography & Micro-Interactions via Motion

- **What Changed:**
  - Upgraded hero headlines to use staggered character/word animations with easing springs.
  - Added a 3D tilt effect on the hero preview card driven by mouse coordinates (`useMotionValue`, `useTransform`, `useSpring`).
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Modern web standards demand rich, responsive tactile feedback. Subtle motion increases engagement and visually differentiates BuildBoard from generic SaaS templates.

---

### Decision 3.4: Accessibility, Reduced-Motion Compliance & Skip Links

- **What Changed:**
  - Added `SkipToContent.jsx` component at the root of `App.jsx`.
  - Added full keyboard traps and Escape key dismissal for mobile drawers and modals.
  - Applied `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` checks across all Motion components and carousels.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Accessibility is non-negotiable. Users with vestibular disorders or visual impairments must have a seamless, safe experience.

---

### Decision 3.5: User Identity Model — Email Keys vs. Name Display

- **What Changed (Commit `7b7f375`):**
  - Updated UI displays to consistently present user display names (`user.name`) rather than raw email addresses across navbars, cards, and feedback author tags, while maintaining normalized email keys internally for demo storage.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Displaying raw emails (`demo@buildboard.dev`) in comments and headers broke UI immersion and felt like unformatted debug data.

---

## 4. Backend Infrastructure & Hybrid Architecture (Phase 4: API & Auth Foundation)

### Decision 4.1: Production Firebase Authentication with Mandatory Email Verification

- **What Changed:**
  - Integrated official Firebase Client SDK (`firebase ^13.1.0`) inside `frontend/src/lib/firebase.js`.
  - Re-implemented `AuthContext.jsx` to wrap `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, `signInWithEmailAndPassword`, `sendEmailVerification`, and `sendPasswordResetEmail`.
  - Enforced a hard verification gate: unverified accounts cannot sign in to access protected features; users are redirected to `EmailVerificationPage.jsx` with real verification status instructions.
  - Converted `SignInPage.jsx` and `SignUpPage.jsx` into production auth forms with comprehensive error mapping (`auth/email-already-in-use`, `auth/wrong-password`, `auth/too-many-requests`, etc.).
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - In earlier iterations, authentication was an insecure in-memory/localStorage string simulation that allowed any user to spoof identity by changing their browser email.
  - Offloading password hashing, salting, session tokens, and verification links to Firebase Authentication ensures enterprise-grade security and avoids storing sensitive credentials in self-hosted databases.

---

### Decision 4.2: Express 5 API Service with Firebase Admin Token Verification

- **What Changed:**
  - Created a dedicated Node.js backend workspace in `backend/` using Express 5 (`express ^5.1.0`) with ESM native modules (`type: "module"`).
  - Configured essential security middleware: `helmet()` for HTTP header protection, strict `cors()` with origin whitelisting, and strict JSON body parsing limits (`32kb`).
  - Implemented token authentication middleware `requireAuth.js` utilizing `firebase-admin/auth` (`verifyIdToken(token, true)` with checkRevoked flag).
  - Extracted verified claims (`firebaseUid`, `email`, `emailVerified`) directly from the cryptographic token rather than trusting request headers or body parameters.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Protects future REST APIs and database queries behind cryptographic signature verification.
  - Decouples client presentation from direct database connections, preventing SQL injection or credential leakage in client bundles.

---

### Decision 4.3: MySQL Identity Schema Keyed by Firebase UID

- **What Changed:**
  - Authored `backend/schema.sql` declaring the `buildboard` database and initial `users` table:
    - Primary key: `id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT`
    - Stable external identifier: `firebase_uid VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL UNIQUE`
    - Contact email: `email VARCHAR(320) NOT NULL UNIQUE`
    - Status flag: `email_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`
  - Added `POST /api/auth/me` endpoint that executes an idempotent upsert (`INSERT INTO users ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`) whenever an authenticated user connects.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Firebase UID provides an immutable, unique identifier that never changes even if a user updates their email address.
  - Relational mapping in MySQL establishes a high-performance foundation for foreign key relations (products, feedback, enrollments) in subsequent migration phases.

---

### Decision 4.4: Staged Hybrid Migration Strategy (Auth/Identity in Cloud, Domain Models in Client Demo)

- **What Changed:**
  - Retained `DemoDataContext.jsx` for product listings, builder checklists, problem threads, and IndexedDB media during this milestone.
  - Connected `AuthContext` to both Firebase (for session management) and the Express API (for MySQL identity sync), while maintaining compatibility with client-side demo data.
  - Configured root script `"dev:api": "npm --prefix backend run dev"` alongside `"dev"` to enable full-stack local development.
- **Why It Was Changed:**
  - Avoided "big bang" rewrite risks: breaking existing rich demo data (checklists, nested comments, IndexedDB videos) during authentication overhaul.
  - Allows team members to test production authentication independently while backend engineers finalize schema migrations for products and feedback.
