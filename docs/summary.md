## 1. What is BuildBoard?

**BuildBoard** is a collaborative web platform where early-stage software builders connect with relevant beta testers to test working prototypes, gather structured critiques, and iterate on their products before public launch.

It transforms the chaotic, superficial process of getting early feedback into a dependable, structured, and mutually beneficial exchange.

---

## 2. The Core Problem & Solution

### The Problem
- **The Upvote Trap**: Broad launch platforms (e.g. Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker News) prioritize visibility, marketing polish, and popularity contests. 
- **Low Signal Feedback**: Builders with early prototypes get superficial comments (*"Cool project! Upvoted!"*) rather than actionable reports on bugs, confusing UX, or missing capabilities.
- **Audience Mismatch**: Builders struggle to find testers who actually possess the relevant technical or domain context (e.g., a Kubernetes devtool tested by someone who has never touched Docker).
- **Lack of Tester Incentive**: Testers who spend 30 minutes testing an unpolished app rarely receive recognition or follow-ups from the maker.

### The BuildBoard Solution
1. **Targeted Audience Specification**: Builders define exactly who their prototype is for (roles, industries, technologies, experience).
2. **Explainable Matching**: Testers discover software aligned with their skills via transparent, score-backed recommendations (`getRecommendedProducts`), where each matching criterion adds +1 to the match score.
3. **Enrollment Gate**: Prototype URLs and testing guidelines are protected until testers actively commit to testing.
4. **Structured Critiques**: Testers submit structured feedback categorized by type (*What worked well*, *Bug or issue*, *Usability*, *UI*, *Feature idea*, *Other*), detailing their experience and specific highlights.
5. **Maker Reply & Recognition Loop**: Builders post an editable reply directly to critiques and toggle a "Helpful" mark, granting the tester public **Recognition Points**.

## 3. Full Feature Inventory (What We Implemented)

### 1. Interactive Landing Page (`LandingPage.jsx`)
- **Kinetic Typography**: Word-by-word animated hero headline (*"Working prototypes. Real feedback."*) with terracotta gradients.
- **3D Interactive Hero Preview**: Floating browser mockup card with real-time mouse-tracking 3D tilt physics and specular highlights.
- **Interactive 4-Card Bento Grid (`InteractiveBentoShowcase.jsx`)**:
  - Live browser preview switching between multiple app prototypes.
  - Interactive criteria tag matcher with real-time profile compatibility calculation.
  - Interactive critique composer with category and severity selectors.
  - Recognition points dynamic counter with badge unlocks.
- **Product Spotlight Carousel**: Clean, responsive spotlight component embedded directly inside `LandingPage.jsx`. (Note: `ShowcaseCarousel.jsx` is maintained in `src/components/` as a continuous fast-paced marquee component).
- **How It Works Timeline**: 3-step connected visual path demonstrating the builder-to-tester lifecycle.

### 2. Catalog & Discovery (`ExplorePage.jsx`)
- **Search & Multi-Axis Filtering**: Instant client-side filtering across keywords, categories, roles, and tech stacks.
- **Explainable Recommendations Engine (`recommendations.js`)**: `getRecommendedProducts` matches tester profile tags against product criteria (+1 point per matched category, role, industry, technology, or explicit experience), presenting transparent reasons sorted by match count.

### 3. Product Details & Enrollment Gate (`ProductDetailsPage.jsx`)
- **Gated Access**: Masks the external prototype link (`productUrl`) and test checklist until the user clicks "Enroll".
- **"What to Try" Task Checklist**: Clear, step-by-step instructions guiding testers through high-priority user journeys.
- **View Counter**: Increments product views on mount via `recordProductView` and surfaces view counts to builders.
- **Feedback Feed**: Chronological list of community critiques with builder responses.

### 4. Structured Feedback System
- **Categorized Inputs**: Submissions classified as *What worked well*, *Bug or issue*, *Usability*, *UI*, *Feature idea*, or *Other*.
- **High-Signal Context**: Prompts testers for *What were you trying to do & what happened?* (`experience`) and *What worked well or what did you like?* (`likes`).
- **Builder Reply**: Product owners can write and edit a dedicated reply on each critique (3–1,000 characters) via `replyToFeedback`.

### 5. Recognition & Reputation System
- **Derived Recognition Points**: Testers receive 1 point whenever a builder marks their feedback as "Helpful" (`toggleFeedbackHelpful`).
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Points are derived from actual feedback records, eliminating database sync drift or counter tampering.

### 6. Builder Analytics Dashboard (`BuilderDashboardPage.jsx`)
- **Multi-Product Analytics**: Aggregates total page views, active enrollments, and feedback submissions.
- **Conversion Funnel Tracking**: Calculates enrollment-to-feedback conversion rates for each listing.
- **Listing Controls**: Instant controls to pause/resume enrollments without resetting listing modification dates.

### 7. Tester Activity Hub (`TesterActivityPage.jsx`)
- **Enrollment Management**: Direct access to all prototypes the tester is currently enrolled in (stored as `"email:productId"` mappings with enrollment timestamps).
- **Time-Tiered Feedback Reminders (`feedbackReminder.js`)**: `getFeedbackReminderInfo` generates contextual reminder banners on the product details page across three elapsed-time tiers: `recent` (<24h), `early` (24–72h), and `followup` (72h+).
- **Dismissal Persistence**: Single-click dismissal stored in localStorage (`buildboard_demo_reminder_dismissals`).
- **Feedback History**: Complete log of past submissions and builder endorsements.

### 8. Community Problems Hub (`ProblemsPage.jsx`, `ProblemDetailsPage.jsx`)
- **Pain Point Validation**: Founders and users post unsolved user problems to validate demand before writing code.
- **Validation Upvotes**: Community members validate problems with a single click (`toggleProblemValidation`).
- **Solution Attachment Hub**: Builders can link their prototypes directly to the problems they solve (`attachProblemSolution`).
- **Reddit-Style Nested Comments**: Multi-level hierarchical comment threads with interactive expand/collapse arrow buttons, clickable thread guidelines, and contextual reply forms.

### 9. User Profile & Targeting (`ProfileSetupPage.jsx`)
- Customization for roles (e.g. *Full Stack Developer*, *Product Designer*), industries (*DevTools*, *SaaS*, *Fintech*), and technical proficiencies (*React*, *Node.js*, *Python*).
- Feeds directly into the deterministic recommendation engine.

## 7. Current State & Next Milestones

### Current State
BuildBoard is currently operating in a **hybrid architecture phase**:
- **Authentication & User Identity**: Fully migrated to production cloud infrastructure. User accounts, secure password hashing, and email verification are managed via **Firebase Authentication**. An **Express 5 API** cryptographically verifies Firebase ID tokens and maintains synchronized user records in **MySQL** keyed by the immutable `firebase_uid`.
- **Domain Modeling & Community Data**: Product listings, testing checklists, enrollment states, reviews, replies, and problem threads currently continue to execute via client-side storage (`localStorage` and `IndexedDB`) to maintain instant prototyping without database migration disruption.

### Next Roadmap Milestones
1. **Full MySQL Domain Data Migration**:
   - Migrate products, enrollments, structured critiques, and problem discussions from `localStorage` to MySQL tables using the schema defined in [`system.md`](file:///Users/yash/Developer/Personal/BuildBoard/docs/system.md).
   - Implement server-side verification of the Enrollment Gate so prototype URLs are masked on the wire until enrollment is validated against MySQL.
2. **Media Storage Cloud Migration**:
   - Transition prototype screenshots and screen recordings from browser `IndexedDB` to Cloud Storage (Firebase Storage / S3 / GCS) with signed URLs.
3. **Automated Testing Suite**:
   - Implement Vitest unit tests for recommendation matching algorithms and Playwright end-to-end testing for the complete enrollment and feedback flow.
3. **Cloud Media & Object Storage**:
   - Graduate from client-side IndexedDB to S3/Cloudflare R2 object storage for custom product screenshot galleries and video streaming.
4. **Email & Webhook Notifications**:
   - Deliver real email digest reminders when testers enroll or builders post replies.
